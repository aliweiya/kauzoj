> what is and isn't welcome at Kaŭzoj

Here at Kaŭzoj I expect it'll be mostly re-hashing old reporting, opinions,
and articles. So with that, comes some content guidelines.

1. Cite Sources.
2. Give Authors' Opinion (yours, the sources you use).
3. Detail what goes For and Against the main opinion of that Cause, Motive, or Action to take.

In addition, I'm going to guess that since it's a content system hosted and
shared on other sites, we've got some ground rules for that content:

* Stuff to remove from git history:
  1. Nothing illegal (for github, facebook, twitter, google, or dropbox)
  2. Nothing that'll go civil
* Stuff to ammend from git history:
  1. Nothing that, in the judgement of the editors, would be false or misleading (we'll correct it)
  2. Pieces that, on their own merrits, don't add up (will try to repair the piece, or move to `_drafts`)
