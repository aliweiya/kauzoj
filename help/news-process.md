Jordan Klepper's show is pretty amazing - by a meta-analysis of news.

He talks allot about satire.

One of TYT's reporters was arrested, [link], and Vox did a piece [link] on
why protests are reported to focus on the violent parts.

I'll have to make sure I either embed myself with the police or get
an understanding that I'm filming the crowd in general. Possibly getting
a press t-shirt?? - most pieces won't need this.
