Infographic How to spot fake news published by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions

The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) published a summary in diagram form (pictured at right) to assist people to recognize fake news.[19] Its main points are:

    Consider the source (to understand its mission and purpose)
    Read beyond the headline (to understand the whole story)
    Check the authors (to see if they are real and credible)
    Assess the supporting sources (to ensure they support the claims)
    Check the date of publication (to see if the story is relevant and up to date)
    Ask if it is a joke (to determine if it is meant to be satire)
    Review your own biases (to see if they are affecting your judgement)
    Ask experts (to get confirmation from independent people with knowledge).

The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), launched in 2015, supports international collaborative efforts in fact-checking, provides training and has published a code of principles.[20] In 2017 it introduced an application and vetting process for journalistic organisations.[21] One of IFCN's verified signatories, the independent, not-for-profit media journal The Conversation, created a short animation explaining its fact checking process, which involves "extra checks and balances, including blind peer review by a second academic expert, additional scrutiny and editorial oversight".[22]

Beginning in the 2017 school year, children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources. Called "media literacy," the course provides training in journalism in the new information society.[23]
