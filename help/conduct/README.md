Still trying to work this out from examples.

## Introduction




---
$CONFERENCE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone [, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion [insert any other specific concerns here]]. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. [Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.] Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference [without a refund] at the discretion of the conference organizers. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:

[URL for full anti-harassment policy]

Long public version

This version focuses on specific instructions to the participants, with the goal of preventing harassment in the first place through education. Suitable for the conference web site and conference program material.

[Insert medium public version of policy here.]

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

    Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination [related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, [your specific concern here].
    Sexual images in public spaces
    Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
    Harassing photography or recording
    Sustained disruption of talks or other events
    Inappropriate physical contact
    Unwelcome sexual attention
    Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately

[Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.]

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference [with no refund].

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. [Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges/head sets.] Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

Anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous report here [Wufoo form or similar that DOES NOT require an email address to submit.

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

Personal Report

You can make a personal report by:

    Calling or messaging this phone number: [Phone number for reporting]. This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of the event.
    Contacting a staff member, identified by STAFF badges, buttons, or shirts.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

[Email address for organizers]
[Phone number for conference security or organizers]
[Phone number for hotel/venue security]
[Local law enforcement]
[Local sexual assault hot line]
[Local emergency and non-emergency medical (e.g., urgent care, day clinic)]
[Local taxi company]

Internal version for conference staff

This version is intended for internal use by the conference staff. It defines an example enforcement policy that can be tweaked to suit your conference organization style.

Warnings

Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the conference's anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to [insert email address/phone number/etc. here] as soon as practical. The report should include:

    Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
    The time you issued the warning
    The behavior that was in violation
    The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
    The circumstances surrounding the incident
    Your identity
    Other people involved in the incident
    [Your guideline here]

Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.

Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

    [Repeat information to gather when making a report here]

Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

    A [first/second/third/seventeenth] offense resulting in a warning from staff
    Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
    A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
    A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
    A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
    [Your guideline here]

Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

    [Repeat conf/hotel/venue/law enforcement/hot line contact info here]

Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.

Conferences in which sex, pornography, racism, etc. are on-topic

Some conferences are both welcoming to all genders and include discussion on topics which are blanket prohibited in the example anti-harassment policy. For example, conferences about supporting geek women or about social justice will necessarily have discussion about topics banned in the example policy, originally written for mainstream technical conferences. We have written an example addendum to the policy that allows discussion of these topics in a manner friendly to women and people in gender, sexual, and romantic minorities. We do not recommended including this addendum unless you have specific real-world examples of content that absolutely require discussion of these topics. See higher risk activities at conferences for guidance on avoiding activities that increase the likelihood of harassment at your conference.

# #compsoc Code of Conduct

\#compsoc aims at being a nice place to chat about computer related things for anyone involved with Edinburgh University.

With that in mind, there is a single rule:

* Don't be a dick

Being a dick could include:

* Feigned surprise. When someone says “I don’t know what X is”, you don’t say “You don’t know what X is?!” or “I can’t believe you don’t know what X is!”.
* Well-actuallys. That is the pedantic corrections that don’t make a difference to the conversation that’s happening.
* Fanboy-ism. Just because Programming Language X has feature Y doesn't mean everyone who doesn't use it is making the biggest mistake of their lives.
* Trolling. Posting something for the sole purpose of starting an argument or annoying other people is stupid.
* Excessive conspiracy-theorying. Consider making your own channel if you feel the need to negatively comment on everything related to a (reasonable) subject.

We do not tolerate harassment of people in any form, including but not limited to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Expect action from an op if you break the rule.

If you feel that another person is violating the rule, or you have other concerns, please contact one of the ops via a PM.

# Code of Conduct

> A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the social norms and rules and responsibilities of, or proper practices for, an individual, party or organization

## Sumary

The {NAME} is dedicated to providing a harassment-free working environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of any form. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any communication and/or talks. Be kind and do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for {NAME}. Staff violating these rules should be reported to an appropriate line manager.

These are the values to which people in the {NAME} community should aspire:

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
  - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
- Be thoughtful
  - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
  - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Be charitable
  - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
  - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  - Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Reporting an incident

Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the {NAME}, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the teams at large, to grow, learn, and become better.

> The following should be handled by a line manager who has been informed of the incident

Try to get as much of the incident in written form. The important information to gather include the following:

- Name and team of the participant doing the harassing
- The location in which the incident occurred
- The behavior that was in violation
- The approximate time of the behavior
- The circumstances surrounding the incident
- Other people involved in the incident

Depending on the severity/details of the incident, please follow these guidelines:

- If there is any general threat to staff or any other doubts, summon security or police
- Offer the victim a private place to sit
- Ask "is there a friend or trusted person who you would like to be with you?" (if so, arrange for someone to fetch this person)
- Ask them "how can I help?"
- Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later
- If everyone is presently physically safe, involve the police or security only at a victim's request

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

- Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with pursuing the complaint" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
- Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility.
- Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff's responsibility.

The line manager who is handling the reported offence should find out the following:

- What happened?
- Are we doing anything about it?
- Who is doing those things?
- When are they doing them?

After the above has been identified and discussed, have an appropriate line manager communicate with the alleged harasser. Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about them.

Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged harasser know what actions will be taken against them.

Some things for the staff to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders:

- Warning the harasser to cease their behaviour and that any further reports will result in sanctions
- Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim until a resolution or course of action has been decided upon
- Requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future events your organisation runs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)
- Depending on the severity/details of the incident, requiring that the harasser immediately be sent home
- Depending on the severity/details of the incident, removing a harasser from membership of relevant {NAME} organisations
- Depending on the severity/details of the incident, publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is a team leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest)

Give accused staff members a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the report stands. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to encourage an apology from the harasser.

It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken - while still respecting the privacy of individual staff members. When speaking to individuals (those who are aware of the incident, but were not involved with the incident) about the incident it is a good idea to keep the details out.

Depending on the incident, the head of responsible department, or designate, may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement either during the plenary and/or through other channels. No one other than the head of responsible department or someone delegated authority from them should make any announcements. No personal information about either party will be disclosed as part of this process.

If some members of staff were angered by the incident, it is best to apologise to them that the incident occurred to begin with. If there are residual hard feelings, suggest to them to write an email to the responsible head of department. It will be dealt with accordingly.

## Anti-harassment Policy

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination -- related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or socioeconomic status -- as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the group. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact organizers immediately.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and social events. We value your attendance.

---

## Organizer Policy

### Warnings

Any organizer can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to event organizers as soon as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information (name) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although an organizer should speak to the presenter afterward. However, organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with further explanation to follow in a less public manner as appropriate.

### Taking Reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

The report should include:

* Identifying information (name) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

### Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A third offense resulting in a warning from other participants
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* Any harassment including physical contact (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* Any intentional (including non-physical) offense, i.e., taking compromising photos
* Organizers and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

### Public Statements

As a general rule, organizers should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the event.

In general, consult with other organizers when possible but act when necessary.
