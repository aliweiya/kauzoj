  title: How to Help
---

I'm always happy to have some help around the shop. Further down the page
you'll find specific 'focuses' where you can just have at it, but don't
feel too stuck in one area. Feel free to lend your ideas for all of it.

In addition to [this repo], there's also a [code of conduct], [content policy], and
[privacy policy] repos.

Besides our [github org], there's a dropbox system and a google docs/emails/calendar
system. You're more than welcome to draft there instead of here if you'd like.

For secure messaging, find @thetoxicarcade and get in touch via ricochet
or similar. More on that later.

A great way to start is to just complain or propose something in the [github issues].

Another is to try making a post or article based on the [template].

[this repo]: //github.com/kauzoj/kauzoj.github.io
[code of conduct]: //github.com/kauzoj/conduct
[content policy]: //github.com/kauzoj/content
[privacy policy]: //github.com/kauzoj/privacy
[github org]: //github.com/kauzoj
[github issues]: //github.com/kauzoj/kauzoj.github.io/issues
[template]: ./template.md


Here are some ways you can help in general.

* Sources
  * Follow news channels and deep-dive thinkers.
  * Add to our list of [sources](./sources)
  * Write about the things of the day
* Categories
  * Add a category or subcategory
  * Respond to a cause (positively or negatively, but always constructively)
  * Write about things you want to change, or things you have comentary about.
* Software
  * Retool Travis tests
  * Rework site theme
  * Propose cool new git repos
* Management
  * Make sure all indexes/lists match the causes heirarchy. Add hyperlinks as needed.
  * Evaluate if pull requests meet code of conduct
* Editorial
  * Add sources to content
  * Locate where people speak on the subject (if in kurzgesagt, does vox talk about it?)


As a final note, sometimes we get into our little bubbles. Part of the editing
process here is to bridge that gap, and bust bubbles, in any way we discover
actually works. Who knows.
