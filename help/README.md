# Kaŭzoj with modules
> If you need a specific thing, head over to that repo


Kaŭzoj is a media project to boost initiatives, hold the powerful
accountable, and think deeply about the media landscape.

We're available via:

* The Website
* The Youtube Channel
* Github
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Instagram
* Dropbox
* Google Drive
* Email

These submodule folders contain projects that make our lives
a little easier. That doesn't mean we won't use outside tools;
sometimes they're really good.

Here's a bit more about them:

* Apps
	* Lazyport - android pushbullet style app
	* Hearsay - API server endpoint
	* Onion - proxy for website / api
	* Editor - scripts for making editing a better experience
* Website (50/50 code/writing) - the website
* Writing
	* Conduct - our conduct policy for people using our services
	* Content - what we do, and don't publish
	* Privacy - how we treat you


Contributions are always welcome, no matter how small.

Encouragement is good, too.
