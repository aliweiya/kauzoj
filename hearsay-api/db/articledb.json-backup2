Just a day after firefighters reported making significant progress, the winds kicked up and pushed flames into the hills at the edge of Sonoma, a town of 11,000. About 400 homes were evacuated in Sonoma and a portion of Santa Rosa that included a retirement community that evacuated earlier this week, authorities said.",

Some law enforcement officials and civil rights groups are skeptical. Among the cons, they point out, is that gun cameras start recording only after weapons are removed from holsters and won't capture what led to officers drawing their guns, or other interactions with the public. They also say they should be used only as a complement to body cameras.",

Jota's seventh goal of the season in the 55th minute set Wolves on their way before half-time substitute Bonatini took his tally to five after 71 minutes. Wolves dominated the match and their margin of victory could have been far greater. Villa had gone into the match on the back of four straight wins but never really got into the game at all.",
