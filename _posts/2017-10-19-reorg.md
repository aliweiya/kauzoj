Merged a bunch of repos, destroyed a bunch of code. Also, todays news.


## Repo Overhaul
We were previously using several repos for detailing Conduct, Content,
Joining, Privacy Policy, an app, and the API. Now they're all under
this singular repo. Hopefully that helps with K.I.S.S.

## API Design

Purpose: to make the news process more comfortable.

Sub-goals:

* Push-To-Save (@Pocket style) functionality
  * Links
  * Documents
  * Images
* Retrieving national news / caching / saving documents
  * News APIs
  * Crawler / CommonCrawl cortex
* Editing existing drafts
  * Lock mechanism (and/or)
  * Live Edit
  * Speech to Text
  * Save media
    * Photos
    * Video
    * Audio
* Sending notifications to subscribers

## Engineering Questions

* Heroku databases (when do they delete their data, if at all?)
* Easy wrapper for cordova app (Gosh I hate making those)
* Websockets vs push notification api
* storing documents/images/video?

## MVP

* return API key on registering
* send link
* get link (websockets event?)
* push/pull/list articles
* push/pull/list crawls
