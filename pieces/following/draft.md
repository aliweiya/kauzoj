Good [Morning|Evening], welcome to the delayed broadcast regarding last
week's news.

The main structure of this recap comes from Medium DOT com, where
Amy Siskind has published a bullet point recap of the week's events,
you can find a link to the source material in our notes.

Donald has launched "Trump TV" on Facebook, featuring [name the two],
one of which, [name], is recieving a salary from the RNC. [further details].

The FCC chair has allowed [when] a regulatory loophole [how, resurfacing?] to
allow sinclair broadcasting to expand its reach [quantitatively, give data], [add details from source article]. [pull details from LWT].

Vox has published [when] a piece saying Fox news just talks to trump.

A WaPo survey said [republicans] supported postponing the election
[are we sure it's because they thought it was illegals?]

Trump has criticized [when, where] affirmitive action discrimination
at american universities [give examples: "such as (blank)"].

A bomb was thrown into the window of a mosque, and we had little
coverage of that. [to save time, just email press@newsagency to double
check for their statements].

A leaked memo [when, by whom?] advised against using the term "climate change". [link to colbert's piece].

[6?] Transgender troops have begun a suit over the president's transgender
ban comments. The [joint chiefs of staff?] have issued a statement
[do we have it on video or in writing?] saying they will not act
until the president has made it through the proper channels. [how soon
will we know if he did that?]. This started off when the president
tweeted [pull colbert's joke on it, delay in timing, source the people alarmed by it]

[some news agency] is tracking the appointees that trump has selected
in a sort-of "deregulation" campaign. [this seems to be something his
supporters like, so tracking it is useful.] there are 85 [listed?] and
"many have industry ties" - said [blank]

A group in [location] has begun a [civil?] suit against the president
in regards to the emoluments lawsuit. That'll start Oct 18th (added
to calendar).

The immigration policies of the president may be to blame for a farmworker
shortage [get locations], [get second source], [get statement from farmers?]

"Trump has made 500 false claims in the first 200 days" - says [report].
[pull in keith olberman's piece from ages ago, too].

a CNN poll [link? similar?] found 24% of americans trust what they hear
from [the white house?].

"[in a sign that his support may be waning], a democrat won in a state
where trump won by 22 points". You may recall earlier when the democrats
pushed to win a [contested?] seat [name of dude, opponent] and lost.
[further...]

There's a document that the president gets every week termed by [wh staff?]
called "The Propoganda Document", containing positive news about him.
That document is delivered at [9:45 & 5?] [pull in comedy show quotes,
they had fun with this.]

Former Campaign Chair [Paul Manifort - where is he now?] experienced
a pre-dawn raid on July 26th. [joke about how his neighbors kept that secret]

Trump made a comment on monday toying with thermonuclear war, that
the NK would be met with "Fire and Fury". How much advice on this subject
is he getting? The papers in front of him were on the opioid crisis
(spelled that right on the first go, when they didn't xD spellchuck.)

Regarding the opioid crisis, trump said "it is now a federal emergency",
but did not provide legal documents or officially invoke federal power
regarding that issue [has he yet?].

An artist has commissioned an inflatable chicken [outside WH lawn? map??]. This kind of thing takes preparation [how much, details, permits?]
Also, another artist has set up an inflatable rat resembling trump
in NYC because the president was scheduled to return [wait, schedule?]

On Friday night, white supremecists, nazis, and the klan marched without
masks, holding tiki/lawn torches, and in general looking quite disturbing.

[fill in when the militia people in body armour were there]

The governer waited until [time], then declaired unlawful assembly and
had them moved [to where?]. Counter-protesters arrived, including
clergy, and some anti-fa, and a brave group of students surrounded
a statue, to which one person on twitter quipped "snowflakes, my ass."
[source]

Moving from the main protest area to a black community that they say
"was experiencing some harrassment" [source], and joined by another
fork [and another?] impromptu, they began moving through the streets
[which weren't blocked off?]. At an intersection, with two cars stopped on their right as they crossed, a [model of car?] sped up
and mowed over protesters, before reversing rapidly on the people behind it.

[19] people were injured, and one [32] year old lady, Heather [?] was
killed. [because of medical staff on hand (in the protest?)] many
deaths were prevented.

The radicalized terrorist, [name], fled with his car, but police apprehended him.

The city's mayor, and the state's governer, were quick to condemn.
Saying "Go Home. There is no place for you here, there is no place
for you in america.".

Trump's response, however, was more lax. He condemned the "hatred,
bigotry, and violence - on many sides", making a quick remark that
seemed to draw moral equivilance between the nazis and people protesting
the nazis.

Other republicans were quick to act, condeming it as "white supremecist terror, plain and simple" - [source]. And finally,
donald sulked and provided "an update", or, more accurately,
a late attempt at doing the right thing.

The damage may have already been done [quick to condemn other things],
[dad was arrested in a 1927 klan riot in queens], [he's trying to build a wall]

In other news, Richard Spencer may be getting his money from cotton
subsidies ($2 million), [worth of farm?] [ownership?]
